Zeus is a weather app built for the Gophercon India 2015 Student Scholarship Competition.
It is completely built in Go. It uses concurrency primitives available in Go to query APIs 
concurrently resulting in fast response times.

The frontend uses Bootstrap and the autocompletion is powered by the Google Maps Javascript API.

It just consists of a form for entering 5 cities and a results page which shows the maximum 
and minimum temperature for those 5 cities on a particular day.

The demo is available at:
